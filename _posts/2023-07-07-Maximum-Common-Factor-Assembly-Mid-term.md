### 原题 
Write an x86 assembly program that finds the maximum common factor of two positive integers stored in the EAX and EBX registers and stores the result in ECX. You are only allowed to use only one label. You are allowed to write a maximum 25 lines of code. Violating any of these conditions will result in losing 4 points.
